    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Manti is a famous meal from my country. To prepare this dish takes time,
      but I'm sure you'll agree it's worth it! Enjoy-afiyet olsun (bon appetit)!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups flour</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon water, or as needed</li>
      <li>2 onions, peeled</li>
      <li>½ pound ground beef</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine the flour and salt in a mixing bowl. Add the eggs and water,
        mixing well with your hands. Add more water, if needed, to form a soft
        dough. Cover and set aside for at least 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Shred the onions and place them in a colander or sieve set over a bowl;
        drain the juice and discard. Combine the onion, ground beef, salt, and
        pepper; mix the meat well with a spoon until mashed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide the dough into two portions and lightly flour a work surface.
        Keep one piece of dough covered while you roll out the second portion
        into a rectangle, rolling the dough as thin as you can. Cut the
        rectangle into 2-inch squares with a knife or pastry wheel.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place about 2 teaspoons of the meat filling in the center of each
        square. Seal the dumplings by gathering the edges of the dough and
        pinching them together at the top to form a bundle. Transfer the
        finished manti to a floured plate, and sprinkle more flour over the
        manti to prevent sticking. Repeat with the second piece of dough.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat the oil and red pepper flakes in a small skillet over low heat just
        until the pepper flakes have started to color the oil; don't let them
        burn. Remove from the heat and keep warm. Stir the minced garlic into
        the yogurt and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium-high heat, and
        cook the manti until the filling is no longer pink, and the dough is
        tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain well. Divide the manti among four
        plates. Spoon the yogurt sauce over the manti and drizzle each serving
        with the hot pepper oil.
      </li>
